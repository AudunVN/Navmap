FLStat is a program by Dan Tascau to display some information contained in the
Freelancer ini files.  This version has been patched by Jason Hood to provide
additional information and features.

Bumped version to 1.20.

By default, don't show blank items.  In addition, extend what is meant by blank
(generally anything that isn't available to the player):

* Bases with an "Info ID" of 0 (and vanilla "Name ID"; most story bases);
* Factions with an "Info ID" of 1 (most story factions);
* Commodities that are neither bought nor sold;
* equipment that cannot be looted or bought;
* Ships that have no package or cannot be bought.

Tweaked the sizes of columns; some have moved and some have been renamed.
Ignore case when sorting name columns.

"Price" is actually an integer, so handle accordingly.

Fixed the Guns/Missiles "Shield Dmg" value (although it still doesn't recognise
the HULL_DAMAGE_FACTOR constant, using a fixed 0.5).

Improved the speed of reading the ini files.
Recognise exponents and negative integers when reading the ini files.
Recognise the bool type when converting BINI files.
Recognise tabs when reading resource DLL names.

Fixed parsing of center-justified infocard text.

Right-click "Copy" will copy the entire list as CSV.

Goods list (when you select a base):
* "Type" uses "turret/missile/torpedo/CD" instead of "gun";
* replaced the "Params" column with just the "Price Modifier".

Factions:
* use four decimals for the "Rep. Chg." columns;
* fix sorting by destruction.

Rep Hacks:
* include "misn" and "know" in determining probability.

Commodities:
* don't consider blank bases when determining the best prices;
* added "Price".

Guns:
* added "Hull Dmg/s", "Shield Dmg/s", "Power/s", "Efficiency", "Value",
  "Rating" and "Range";
* Efficiency: damage / power, using whichever damage is greater;
* Value: damage/s / price * 1000, using whichever damage is greater;
* Rating: Efficiency * Value.

Missiles:
* added "Ammo Price", "Efficiency", "Value", "Radius", and "Motor Lifetime";
* remove "Class" for torpedos & disruptors;
* Efficiency: damage / power, using whichever damage is greater;
* Value: damage / ammo price, using whichever damage is greater;
* use "dumb" if "Seeker" is not "lock";
* increase "Lifetime" and "Motor Acceleration" to four decimals;
* fixed the "Max Range" value;
* added ranges & speeds when travelling at 80 & 200 m/s (range sorts at 200).

Mines:
* added "Price", "Ammo Price", "Value" and "Radius";
* Value: damage / ammo price.

Shields:
* added "Type" (old "Type" becomes "Technology"), "Price" and "Value";
* Value: shield_value / price * 1000, where shield_value is capacity,
	 regeneration_rate or constant_power_draw, whichever is not 0.

Thrusters:
* added "Price", "Efficiency", "Value" and "Rating";
* Efficiency: max_force / power;
	      power if max_force is 0;
* Value: max_force / price;
	 power * 1000 / price if max_force is 0;
* Rating: max_force / (power - 100) * Value / 1000 (where 100 is the standard
  thrust recharge rate).

Ships:
* exclude ships where nickname comes before ids_name (rtc props and random
  mission objects that have been included in shiparch.ini);
* converted radians ("rad") to degrees ("deg"), using two decimals;
* consider linear_drag when determining "Impulse Speed";
* use blank (instead of "0") when there is no engine or powerplant.

Ship Details:
* allow (Shift+)Ctrl+Tab to select it;
* condense gun, turret & shield columns into a single column of class numbers;
* sort hardpoints the same as the mounts;
* recognise the additional EngClass hp_types.

Commodities Export:
* use "Base" in the header (instead of "Locations");
* use blank (instead of "None") if no ships are sold;
* fix "Sells" value;
* commodities will be the same as the Commodities tab.

SQL Export:
* modified to work with SQLite;
* changed file name to just "FLStat.sql";
* added batch file to run "sqlite3", providing queries to emulate FLStat;
* rearranged and formatted columns (tab size 8) to work as a straight text dump;
* added tables to convert categories/types to names;
* equipment: added "buyable" flag;
* gun_type: explicitly added 0 as a blank name;
* explosion: renamed "energy_dmg" to "shield_dmg";
	     removed "strength" (Freelancer doesn't even read it);
* motor: fixed reading "nickname" from the configuration;
* munition: renamed "life_time" to "lifetime";
* gun: renamed "refire_delay" to "refire_rate";
* minedropper: added "dmg_per_fire", "power_usage", "refire_rate", "velocity"
	       and "toughness";
* shield: added "category" (the new "Type" in FLStat);
* ship: renamed "shield_batts" to "batteries";
	removed "engine_speed" (calculable from engine);
	added "linear_drag" (for proper speed calculation);
* _power: exclude plants with capacity = 1 (assumed prop);
* ship_package: fixed relationship to ship (removed ship_hull table);
		renamed "ship_hull_id" to "ship_id";
* faction: use "[nickname]" for non-existent long or short name;
* system: use "[nickname]" for non-existent name;
* base: use "[nickname]" for non-existent name;
* base_equip: renamed "param1" to "level_reqd";
	      renamed "param2" to "rep_reqd";
	      renamed "param3" to "min_inv";
	      renamed "param4" to "stock";
	      renamed "param5" to "full_resale";
	      renamed "param6" to "price_modifier";
* rep_hack: renamed "occurence" to "occurrence".


Known Problems:

* if category does not follow nickname in [Good], the good is ignored;
* if a ship has multiple packages, only the last is tested - if it is not sold,
  the ship is considered blank (does not affect SQL).


Changes from v1.10:

* fixed tabs in freelancer.ini preventing resource DLLs from loading;
* fixed & improved Commodities Export;
* exclude [Power] when capacity = 1 (props);
* exclude [Ship] when nickname comes before ids_name (props & mission objects);
* fixed "Impulse Speed" value (add ship's linear drag to engine's);
* recognise power/thruster boosters, shield capacitors/generators;
* recognise the additional hardpoints used by EngClass;
* custom bases with no infocard are no longer blank;
* blank equipment is determined by its lootable and buyable status;
* blank ships are determined by no package or not buyable;
* SQL: added "buyable" to equipment table;
* SQL: added "linear_drag" to ship table;
* SQL: renamed "restock" to "min_inv" & "buy_only" to "full_resale";
* SQL: explicitly write "[nickname]" in faction, system & base tables;
* SQL: added "Engines" and "Powerplants" queries.
